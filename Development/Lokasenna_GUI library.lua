About:
    Provides a framework allowing Lua scripts to use a graphical interface, since Reaper
    has no ability to do so natively.
    INSTALLATION: After installing this package, you must tell Reaper where to find the
    library. In the Action List, find and run:
    "Script: Set Lokasenna_GUI library path.lua"
